# Cosmography_from_DEEoS
Since any attempt to constrain the EoS requires fixing some prior in one form or the other, settling a method to 
constrain cosmological parameters is of great importance.  In the following codes, I provide a straightforward 
approach to show how cosmological tests can be improved without constraining the cosmographic parameters and 
obtain them directly from cosmological constraints.
