# Cosmography from Dark Energy equation of state
Since any attempt to constrain the EoS requires fixing some prior in one form or the other, settling a method to 
constrain cosmological parameters is of great importance.  In the following codes, I provide a straightforward 
approach to show how cosmological tests can be improved without constraining the cosmographic parameters and 
obtain them directly from cosmological constraints.

These codes aims at helping researchers to effortlessly carry out Cosmography within Wolfram Mathematica. Much of the workflow has been automatized. At the moment, explores the bidimensional dark energy parameterisations on a MCMC grid. 

Have fun, Celia.
