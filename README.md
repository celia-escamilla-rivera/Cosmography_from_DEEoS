# Cosmography from Dark Energy equation of state
Since any attempt to constrain the EoS requires fixing some prior in one form or the other, settling a method to 
constrain cosmological parameters is of great importance.  In the following codes, I provide a straightforward 
approach to show how cosmological tests can be improved without constraining the cosmographic parameters and 
obtain them directly from cosmological constraints.

Cosmography_from_DEEoS aims at helping researchers to effortlessly carry out Cosmography within Wolfram Mathematica. Much of the workflow has been automatized. At the moment, explores the bidimensional dark energy parameterisations on a MCMC grid. 

Have fun, Celia.
